[psi4-step]
# Maximum number of threads (cores) to use
# ncores = available

# Total amount of memory to use
# Use kB, MB, GB (1k = 1000) or kiB, MiB, GiB (1k = 1024)
# The default is to use the same proportion of memory as
# cores being used.
# memory = available

# How much of the memory to use. Defaults to 90% to allow
# for Psi4 not perfectly tracking its memory requirements.
# memory-factor = 90%
